# ESAPI Encoder
#
# ESAPI canonicalizes input before validation to prevent bypassing filters with encoded attacks.
# Failure to canonicalize input is a very common mistake when implementing validation schemes.
# Canonicalization is automatic when using the ESAPI Validator, but you can also use the
# following code to canonicalize data.
#
#      ESAPI.Encoder().canonicalize( "%22hello world&#x22;" );
#
# Multiple encoding is when a single encoding format is applied multiple times. Allowing
# multiple encoding is strongly discouraged.
Encoder.AllowMultipleEncoding=false

# Mixed encoding is when multiple different encoding formats are applied, or when
# multiple formats are nested. Allowing multiple encoding is strongly discouraged.
Encoder.AllowMixedEncoding=false

# The default list of codecs to apply when canonicalizing untrusted data. The list should include the codecs
# for all downstream interpreters or decoders. For example, if the data is likely to end up in a URL, HTML, or
# inside JavaScript, then the list of codecs below is appropriate. The order of the list is not terribly important.
#
# Available Codecs:
#    HTMLEntityCodec, PercentCodec, JavaScriptCodec, VBScriptCodec, CSSCodec, XMLEntityCodec, Base64, PushbackString,
#    DB2Codec, MySQLCodec, OracleCodec, UnixCodec, WindowsCodec
